#line_begin
In addition, functional data were denoised using a confound regression pipeline incorporating established nuisance regressors [CITATION2]. This included the removal of potential confounding effects derived from

#bandpass
[IF regbp 1 followed by ][IF regbp 2 and simultaneous ]bandpass frequency filtering of the BOLD timeseries[CITATION8] between [VALUE 1 filter] Hz and [VALUE 2 filter] Hz

#line_summary1
Based on the number of nuisance regressors included, the effective temporal degrees of freedom of the denoised BOLD signal ranged from [VALUE 1 QC_DOF_min] to [VALUE 1 QC_DOF_max] (mean [VALUE 1 QC_DOF_mean]) across subjects[CITATION7].

#line_summary2
After outlier removal there were an average of [VALUE 1 QC_ValidScans_mean] functional scans/acquisitions per subject (ranging from [VALUE 1 QC_ValidScans_min] to [VALUE 1 QC_ValidScans_max]).

#line_summary3
Residual inter-scan motion (also computed after outlier removal) was [VALUE 1 QC_MeanMotion_mean]mm on average, ranging from [VALUE 1 QC_MeanMotion_mean]mm to [VALUE 1 QC_MeanMotion_mean]mm.
