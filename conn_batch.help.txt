  CONN BATCH batch functionality for connectivity toolbox
  
  Defines experiment information and/or run processing steps programmatically
  
  CONN_BATCH syntax:
  
  1) conn_batch(BATCH);
     where BATCH is a structure (with fields defined in the section below)
     e.g. 
        clear BATCH;
        BATCH.Setup.RT=2;
        conn_batch(BATCH);
  
  2) conn_batch('fieldname1',fieldvalue1,'fieldname2',fieldvalue2,...) 
     where 'fieldname*' are individual BATCH structure fields
     e.g. 
        conn_batch('Setup.RT',2); 
  
  3) conn_batch(batchfilename)
     where batchfilename is a .mat file containing a batch structure
     or a .m file containing a Matlab script
     e.g.
        conn_batch('mybatchfile.mat');
 
  note1: in standalone releases use syntax (from system-prompt):
      conn batch batchfilename    : runs a batch file (.m or .mat)
      conn batch "matlabcommands" : runs one or several matlab commands 
  note2: syntax conn_batch({BATCH1 BATCH2 ...}) processes sequentially multiple batch structures (equivalent to 
        conn_batch(BATCH1); conn_batch(BATCH2); ... e.g. useful when defining/running multiple first- or 
        second- level analyses)

                              (97th percentile) settings; to use the "conservative" (95th percentile) settings use
