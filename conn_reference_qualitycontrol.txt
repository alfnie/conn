Quality Control procedures included the computation of Data Validity, Quality, and Sensitivity scores, providing quantitative assessments of global distributional biases, motion-related confounds, and group-level sensitivity to small FC effects after preprocessing and denoising. First, global biases in FC estimates were characterized by the Data Validity score, measuring the displacement of the empirical FC distribution peak from zero, its expected value in the absence of systematic biases [CITATION3]. Second, motion and outlier-related confounds were evaluated using QC-FC correlations [CITATION4] between FC values and subject motion and outlier-prevalence measures. These effects were summarized by the Data Quality score, defined as the Overlap Coefficient between the observed QC-FC correlation distribution and its permutation-derived null distribution [CITATION5][CITATION6]. Last, Sensitivity was quantified as the statistical power to detect a small target FC effect (r=0.1) in a fixed-effects analysis, using a Welch-Satterthwaite approximation for effective degrees of freedom [CITATION7], and excluding participants whose QC metrics were extreme outliers (values more than three interquartile ranges beyond the first or third quartile). Data Validity, Quality, and Sensitivity scores are expressed in percent units and interpreted using three broad categories: low (<80[PRC]), intermediate (80–95[PRC]), and high (>95[PRC]) values.
